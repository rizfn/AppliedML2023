## Regression

Nothing new: we're just doing stuff from last week.

If you have a lot of missing values, trees work well, NNs don't.

The default and most used minimizer is Adam.

For a regression, you can have 2 outputs instead of 1: you can predict the continuous variable, and you can also have the second variable represent the uncertainity. You need to change the loss function to represent that.
